Description: Set external encoding to UTF-8 for readme_spec.rb
 In sbuild environment, the default external encoding for specs run by the rake
 method seems to be ASCII. This causes an encoding error when trying to read
 the UTF-8 README file.
 Default external encoding is thus forced in this test file to UTF-8 to ensure
 that the file will be read correctly.
